End-to-end Customer Churn Prediction using Python and Machine Learning
# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company’s products or services. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive actions to retain customers — which drives revenue and reduces loss.

In this project, we performed:

✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Feature engineering  
✔ Model training and evaluation  
✔ Business insights and recommendations

📁 The primary file in this repo is:

- **Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb** — A Jupyter notebook with full steps, code, and visualizations.

## 📌 Model Summary

I trained a **Random Forest classifier** that achieved solid performance on the test set.

The model identifies important churn drivers such as:

✔ Contract type  
✔ Total charges  
✔ Tenure  
✔ Monthly charges  
✔ Internet service type  
✔ Payment method

## Key Insights

From the data analysis:

- Customers on *month-to-month contracts* churn more than long-term contracts.
- Higher *monthly charges* and lower *tenure* are associated with more churn.
- Certain *payment methods* and internet types have higher churn percentages.
